# Screen-Freen
This is a Screen Time monitor which tracks how much time you spent on your PC. More details below

# Here's a quick overview of what Screen-Freen is going to do (in the future)
* stores how much I spent time on PC in a log file
* every 30 minutes it gives notification to get off of my chair and do eye exercise
* and dims the whole screen to 0% brightness for 30 seconds
* every 1 hour it gives notification of the screentime
* logs previous screentimes
* everytime I boot up my PC, it will give notification of how much time I spent off of PC
* the software runs on boot

``To be honest, I got no idea how I going to do this.``

I am planning to start this project after July 24.
my exams :'(

**Note To My Future Self:** Pls complete this project
